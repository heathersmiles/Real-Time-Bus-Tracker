# Real Time Bus Tracker

## Project Description
Create a web page that uses an API (mapbox) to source real-time data of the Boston MBTA buses. Display the location of the bus stops between MIT & Harvard on a map.

## How to use it?
1. Download the following 4 files from the master branch of this repository into a directory on your local machine:<br />
	mapanimation.js<br />
	index.html<br />
	styles.css<br />
	package.json

2. Open index.html in your browser of choice.

3. Click the button labeled, "Show stops between MIT and Harvard".

##Project Roadmap
In the future, add links to additional cities' real-time bus maps.
